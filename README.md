This repository contains the detailed 3D model and 2D schematics of a complete **45° angled leg press machine**. The project includes all individual components, meticulously designed in AutoCAD to reflect real-world dimensions and biomechanical efficiency.

## Project Contents

### 3D Models
The 3D models for each part of the leg press are included. These models are provided in a format compatible with AutoCAD and other 3D modeling software. The parts are designed with precision using real-world dimensions at a **1:1 scale**.

### 2D Schematics
Accompanying the 3D models are 2D schematics created using three orthographic projections (**Front View, Top View, Side View**). These schematics include precise measurements taken directly from fitness equipment to provide a detailed reference for each component.
